I can see a store called Netto to the south. To the east of Netto, there is a parking lot dedicated to the store.
To the north of Netto and its parking lot, there is a pedestrian sidewalk, and just to the north of that, there is a road for vehicles.
Beyond that vehicle road to the north, there is a roadside parking lot.
And to the north of the parking lot, there is a cemetery.
