Could you convert the following sentences:

"--Placeholder for the user-generated text description--"

into the format:
"The [object1] is on the [direction] of the [object2]"
For example: "The building is on the west of the car_parking".

In this format, both object1 and object2 should refer to individual, distinct objects, not combinations or groups of objects.
Also, if an object name consists of multiple words, please connect them with underscores (e.g., "car_parking" instead of "car parking").
Please exclude any sentence that describes the spatial relation between the observer and an object.
